# RECOMmusicENDATIONS

### [View website](https://karmatys8.github.io/RECOMmusicENDATIONS)

### Built on Spotify API

### Hosted on GitHub Pages

## Description:

Main purpose of this project was to learn React, fetching from APIs and how to use Git and GitHub.
Developed with Mobile First Design. Idea sparked out while reading APIs features
and recalling frustration from mismatched Spotify recommendations.<br>

## The most crucial techniques that I have improved at/learned are:

* React components and states
* Fetching
* Data processing
* Git commands and terminal usage in general
* CSS pseudo-classes
* Writing README.md files
* Projects file structure

## Quick showcase

## Possible issues

* Filtering by tag:new(releases from past 2 weeks) seems not to work with genres. [Read more.](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Spotify-for-Developers/API-No-way-to-search-tag-new-with-genre/td-p/5483721)

## Further improvements

* Spotify uses HTTP/1.1 instead of HTTP/2
* Can't change neither format of images nor their size from Spotifys response. There are some APIs that can do the later however, their either to [slow](https://rapidapi.com/jdiez/api/mediacrush/pricing) [(2nd link)](https://www.filestack.com/pricing/#/marketplace) or have [too low of a limit](https://www.abstractapi.com/api/image-processing-optimization-api#pricing) to be beneficial. There is also [proxy](https://imgproxy.net/#pro) option but I still would have to invest time/money into it.
* There is a lot of main-thread work being done. Most of it is what lighthouse classifies as "Other". Not really sure how to tackle this problem. [Only clue.](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/issues/11478)
* Total Blocking Time is high from what seems expensive animations and rendering. But it would take a lot of effort to fix it and I have not found it disturbing.

**Note:** "Tablet and desktop design" branch is left on purpose for nostalgic purposes.
